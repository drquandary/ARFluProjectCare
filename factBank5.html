      // Fact Bank
      const factBank = {
        fluFacts: [
        
    "1. Can the flu vaccine give my child the flu?",
    "Fact: No, the flu vaccine cannot give your child the flu. The injected flu vaccine contains a dead piece of the virus that cannot give you the flu. If your child feels achy or has a slight fever, it is a normal reaction of the immune system to the vaccine, and generally lasts only a day or two.",
    "2. Do healthy kids need to get the flu vaccine each year?",
    "Fact: Yes, your child should get a flu vaccine each year even if they’re healthy. The CDC recommends that nearly everyone 6 months of age and older get a flu vaccine each year. This is because a person’s immune protection from vaccination declines over time. Flu viruses are also constantly changing, so getting an updated vaccine each year is most effective at preventing flu.",
    "3. Will my child have serious side effects from the flu vaccine?",
    "Fact: No. Some children may have mild side effects after getting the flu vaccine, but they usually only last 1-2 days. The most common side effects from injected flu vaccines are low-grade fever, headache, muscle aches or soreness, redness, tenderness or swelling where the vaccine was given. These side effects begin shortly after receiving the vaccine for some people and usually last 1-2 days.",
    "4. Is the flu just a bad cold?",
    "Fact: No, the flu is not just a bad cold. Flu infection can put your child at risk for serious complications and hospitalization, even if they are otherwise healthy. Getting vaccinated against the flu is the safer choice.",
    "5. Are the side effects of the flu vaccine worse than the flu?",
    "Fact: No, the side effects that your child may experience from the flu vaccine are less severe than symptoms of the actual flu virus. Side effects from the flu vaccine usually only last 1-2 days and are mild, while getting the flu can result in serious illness. This is especially true for those who are at higher risk such as young children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with certain chronic health conditions like asthma, heart disease, or diabetes.",
    "6. Can children get seriously ill or die from the flu?",
    "Fact: Yes, the flu vaccine saves the lives of babies and young children every year. Children, especially babies and young children, are especially at risk of getting serious flu illness. A 2022 study found that flu vaccines reduced children’s risk of severe, life-threatening flu illness. On average, 20,000 children under 5 in the United States are hospitalized each year due to complications from the flu illness.",
    "7. Can my child still spread the flu even if they are feeling well?",
    "Fact: Yes, your child can still spread the flu virus even if you are not having symptoms. Getting your child their flu vaccine will help protect vulnerable members of your family and community. When your child gets their flu vaccine, they will be less likely to spread the flu to others, protecting family and community members who are at high risk such as other children, older people, and people with chronic health conditions.",
    "8. Will my child have immediate protection from the flu after getting the flu vaccine?",
    "Fact: No. It can take up to two weeks after getting the flu vaccine for your child to develop immunity to the flu virus. It takes the body two weeks to develop immunity to the flu virus after getting the flu vaccine.",
    "9. Is there any value in my child getting their flu vaccine after November?",
    "Fact: Yes, it is still beneficial for your child to get a flu vaccine even if it’s December or January. It is recommended that everyone get their flu vaccine by the end of October, but the flu season lasts well into the spring, so getting vaccinated in the winter will still provide months of protection against the flu virus.",
    "10. If my child gets the flu, can I treat them with antibiotics?",
    "Fact: No, antibiotics do not work on viruses, including the flu. Antibiotics will not help your child if they have the flu. This is because the flu is caused by a virus. Antibiotics are instead used to cure bacterial infections, not viral infections.",
    "11. Can I get a flu vaccine even though I’m pregnant?",
    "Fact: Yes, you can and should get a flu vaccine while you’re pregnant. Pregnant women and children younger than 5 years of age are at greater risk of getting sick from the flu. It is very important that they get vaccinated. Pregnant women should only receive the injected flu vaccine, not any other forms of the flu vaccine.",
    "12. Can my child get the flu more than once a season?",
    "Fact: Yes, your child can get the flu more than once a season. It is possible for your child to get the flu twice during the same flu season because there are two types of flu strains. Even though your child got the flu once, they could still be infected with the other type.",
    "13. Is it worth it for my child to get the flu vaccine if they can still potentially get the flu?",
    "Fact: Yes, it is still worth it for your child to get the flu vaccine even though it is true that some people who get vaccinated still get the flu. The flu vaccine varies in how well it works and may not work as well for people with compromised immune systems. However, studies show that people who get vaccinated but still got the flu have less severe symptoms than people who weren’t vaccinated and get the flu.",
    "14. Can my child with a chronic illness get the flu vaccine?",
    "Fact: Yes. Most kids ages 6 months and older should get a yearly flu vaccine, including kids with chronic illnesses. If your child has a chronic illness, they may be at increased risk of becoming severely ill or hospitalized from the flu, so it is important that they get their flu vaccine if they can. Talk to your child’s doctor or pediatrician if you are unsure if your child should be getting a flu vaccine this year.",
    "15. Can my child get the flu vaccine even if they don’t have a regular doctor or pediatrician?",
    "Fact: Yes, your child can still get a flu vaccine even if they don’t have a regular doctor. Flu vaccines are provided at drugstores, urgent care clinics, and the public health department. You can find specific locations near you by using the vaccine finder link (https://vaccinefinder.org/).",
    "16. Can my child get a flu vaccine for free or at a low cost?",
    "Fact: Yes, your child can get a flu vaccine for no or low-cost. If you have health insurance, contact your doctor or pharmacy to schedule an appointment for the flu vaccine. If you don’t have health insurance, the City of Philadelphia offers walk-in clinics for flu vaccines. More information can be found at https://www.phila.gov/services/mental-physical-health/get-vaccinated/get-your-annual-flu-shot/",
    "17. Can my child catch the flu by going out in cold weather without a coat, with wet hair, or by sitting near a drafty window?",
    "Fact: No, the only way to catch the flu is by being exposed to the flu virus. The flu vaccine prevents infection caused by the flu virus. Because flu season coincides with cold weather, people often associate the flu with a cold, drafty environment. But they are not related.",
    "18. Do kids even need to get the flu vaccine?",
    "Fact: Yes, kids 6 months of age and older should get a yearly flu vaccine. Children are less likely to have immunity against flu viruses and are therefore more likely to get infected. The flu vaccine gives kids immunity.",
    "19. Does the flu vaccine work?",
    "Fact: Yes, the flu vaccine works to protect your child against the flu virus. While protection from the flu vaccine can vary, getting vaccinated is the single best way to prevent the flu.",
    "20. Is the flu vaccine safe?",
    "Fact: Yes, the flu vaccine is safe. Hundreds of millions of people have safely received the flu vaccine over the past 50 years.",
    "21. Can my child get a flu vaccine early in flu season?",
    "Fact: Yes. Most people get the flu between December and February, but your child can get sick as early as October. This is why everyone should get vaccinated by the end of October if possible. Waiting leaves your child exposed to the virus when people are starting to get infected.",
    "22. My child has never had the flu before. Do they still need a flu vaccine?",
    "Fact: Yes, unfortunately, a flu-free history doesn’t guarantee a flu-free future. Flu strains change over time, which means your child is at risk every year they aren’t vaccinated. In addition, your unvaccinated child may get the flu without symptoms and still pass the flu virus to others.",
    "23. Can my child still build immunity against the flu with the flu vaccine?",
    "Fact: Yes, your child will still build immunity against the flu after they get the flu vaccine. Getting the flu virus itself will not give your child more immunity than getting the flu vaccine. The flu can get serious fast, especially in children. Getting vaccinated is much safer and comes with the same immunity benefits.",
    "24. Will the flu vaccine boost my child’s immune system?",
    "Fact: Yes, the flu vaccine will help your child’s immune system fight the flu virus. The flu vaccine helps your child’s immune system get ready in case they are exposed to the flu virus."
